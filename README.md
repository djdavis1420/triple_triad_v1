# TRIPLE TRIAD

This is a personal project to recreate the trading card game from Final Fantasy 8.

The initial goal of this project is simply to implement the functionality of the game with random decks and hands.

Additional goals include allowing players to choose cards from persistent decks and implementing a graphical interface.
